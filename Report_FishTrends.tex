\section{Rationale and Research
Questions}\label{rationale-and-research-questions}}

As public awareness of increasing strains on ocean resources and
organisms grows (e.g.~see the reach of films such as Seaspiracy and
Sonic Sea), more attention is being placed on understanding fishing
patterns and the impacts they have on the oceans. Most of this attention
is placed on commercial and industrial fishing operations, which are
studied and managed by the federal agency NOAA, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration. However, there are fewer studies on
recreational fishing, for which NOAA also aids in overseeing and
collects data.

For this study, we chose to investigate recreational fishing trends in
North Carolina over a thirty-year period. The data, whose origins are
discussed more below, initially included 27 variables, detailing
information such as mode of fishing and wave (2-month time period) the
data was caught in. For this analysis, we wanted to look specifically at
total catch during each wave, as we were running time series analyses
during the course of the project. Therefore, we focused on only one
catch estimation variable: total catch. We chose North Carolina due to
our familiarity with species here, and we chose two popular recreational
fishing species to investigate alongside all species combined. Trends in
recreational fishing data can give us information about human behavior,
species populations, and species movement patterns, which is why we
found this topic interesting and wanted to investigate it further.

We chose the following questions to guide our work:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Are there trends in the amount of these fish caught over time? How do
  they compare?
\item
  What could these trends look like in the future?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{data-retrieval}{%
\subsection{Data Retrieval:}\label{data-retrieval}}

For this analysis, we used data collected during Marine Recreational
Information Program (MRIP) surveys conducted by NOAA
(\href{https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/recreational-fishing-data/about-marine-recreational-information-program}{\textbf{NOAA
n.d.}}). NOAA works with state and local partners to collect information
on the species and number of fish caught by fishers via in-person
communication, telephone surveys, and mail-in surveys. We retrieved the
data using the NOAA Recreational Fisheries Statistics Queries ``download
query'' tool (found
\href{https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/data-tools/recreational-fisheries-statistics-queries}{\textbf{here}}).
We created three separate queries to download data: one for all species,
one for bluefish (\emph{Pomatomus saltatrix}), and one for black sea
bass (\emph{Centropristis striata}). For each query, we used the date
range 1990-2019 and requested catch estimate data by ``wave'', or
two-month period, for all waves, fishing modes, and areas of fishing for
the state of North Carolina (Table 1). We downloaded the CSVs as ZIP
files and added them to our project repository. All data and code for
this project can be retrieved from the
\href{https://github.com/ardathdixon/Data_FinalProject}{\textbf{GitHub
repository}}.

\hypertarget{data-wrangling}{%
\subsection{Data Wrangling:}\label{data-wrangling}}

We began our analysis by selecting the following columns from the raw
data CSV files: Year, Wave, Mode, Area, and Total Catch. Next, we
created a custom function to convert waves to months in order to process
the six annual waves using time series analysis. For NOAA fishing
records, wave 1 represents January and February, wave 2 represents March
and April, and this continues through the year. Therefore, we assigned
wave 1 catches to the date of January 1, wave 2 catches to March 1, and
beyond.

After applying the custom wave-to-month function to the data, we created
a date variable to capture year and month together (the day value for
each of these dates was 01). Next, we used a split-apply-combine
approach to find the sum of total catch for each wave. Each of these
sums contains the catch from all unique combinations of fishing mode and
area that were recorded during a given wave. Finally, to create the time
series, we selected only the columns for date (DATE) and the sum of
total catch (TOT\_CAT\_ALL). We computed summary statistics for these
total catch values, as shown in Table 2. We then proceeded with
exploratory analysis and interpolation of missing data points, which are
described below.

\begin{table}[H]

\hypertarget{exploratory-analysis}{%
\section{Exploratory Analysis}\label{exploratory-analysis}}

Following initial wrangling, we checked the number of waves without
catch records for each dataset by joining the existing data to a list of
all possible waves between wave 1 of 1990 (represented by 1990-01-01)
and wave 6 of 2019 (represented by 2019-11-01). The results of this
exploration, which informed our approach for interpolation, can be found
in Table 3.

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:table3}Number of missing values from NOAA MRIP data}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{l|r}
\hline
Dataset & Number of missing values\\
\hline
All fish & 11\\
\hline
Bluefish & 17\\
\hline
Black sea bass & 13\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To fill the gaps with no data, we interpolated the likely values of
missing time periods. This linear interpolation incorporated the catch
numbers on either side chronologically. If wave 1 of 1990 or wave 6 of
2019 was missing, we did not interpolate the value, as there would not
be a measurement available on both sides. We graphed the total catch
trends over time (with the newly interpolated values for missing
periods) as shown in Figure 1. With this visualization, we could compare
the three categories' recreational fishing catch patterns: all fish,
bluefish, and black sea bass.

After our exploratory analysis and interpolation of the missing data
points for each dataset, we created three time series for further
analysis. We investigated the trends in total catch for all fish (Figure
2), bluefish (Figure 3), and black sea bass (Figure 4) by decomposing
the time series into their seasonal, trend, and remainder components.
For all three time series, we observed a strong seasonal trend with low
catch totals in the winter and high catch totals in the summer.
Furthermore, each trend component showed an apparent increase in total
catch over time.

\hfill{}\includegraphics{Report_FishTrends_files/figure-latex/Black Sea Bass Trends-1} 

\caption{Seasonal and Trend Decomposition for Black Sea Bass Total Catch}\label{fig:Black Sea Bass Trends}
\end{figure}

We ran a Seasonal Mann-Kendall test on each time series to test whether
there was a monotonic trend in the total number of fish caught over time
(Table 4). All three tests returned a statistically significant result
(All fish: tau = 0.49, p \textless{} 2.22 x 10\^{}-16; bluefish: tau =
0.32, p = 8.75 x 10\^{}-10; black sea bass: tau = 0.41, p = 8.44 x
10\^{}-15). Therefore, for all three time series, we reject the null
hypothesis that there is no monotonic trend in favor of the alternative
hypothesis that there is a trend in the data over time.

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:table4}Seasonal Mann Kendall Tests}

\begin{tabular}[t]{l|r|l}
\hline

\hline
Bluefish & 0.3235180 & 8.748902e-10\\
\hline
Black Sea Bass & 0.4095312 & 8.437695e-15\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\emph{Note on Table 4: p-values in this table were generated from
wrangling the outputs from the seasonal Mann-Kendall tests. This
wrangling rounded the p-value for all fish from \textless{} 2.22 x
10\^{}-16 to 0.}

The strengths of these trends vary; based on tau values, catch for all
fish has the strongest overall trend while bluefish has the weakest
overall trend. Nonetheless, total catch for both individual species and
all species combined increases between the beginning of 1990 and the end
of 2019.

\subsection{Question 2: What could these trends look like in the
future?}\label{question-2-what-could-these-trends-look-like-in-the-future}}

To investigate future trends, we used forecasting in R to predict future
data based on the existing past data we pulled from NOAA. There are
several different methods through which to forecast, though only some of
them account for seasonality, which was necessary here due to the
seasonal components found in all three of our time series. We chose to
use the Holt-Winters forecasting method for this data. Holt-Winters is
more complex than simpler methods like naive forecasting, but it
requires knowledge of fewer additional variables that other models, like
SARIMA, need in order to run. Holt-Winters uses smooth exponentiating
and varying weights of past data - with more recent data weighed more -
to predict future data. Here, we predicted five years of data (where h =
number of periods, and each period = 2 months). In the resulting plots,
the dark blue area represents the 80\% confidence interval level for
predicted data, while the light blue area represents the 95\% confidence
interval level.

\begin{figure}[H]

\hfill{}\includegraphics{Report_FishTrends_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-1-1} 

\caption{Holt-Winters Catch Forecasts}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-1}
\end{figure}

The Holt-Winters plots (Figure 5) all show clear continued seasonal
patterns and trends. For black sea bass and all species combined,
overall future trends are expected to be positive, like the past trends.
For bluefish, the forecasted trend is slightly negative -- this is
likely because the most recent years of bluefish data do show a slight
negative slope, even though the trend is positive for the full thirty
years in the dataset (though as noted above, bluefish has the smallest
tau, and therefore the weakest trend). These forecasting plots are
useful visualizations but should not be considered fully accurate
because of these inherent complexities in fishing catch data that models
like Holt-Winters cannot account for.

\hypertarget{strong-seasonal-trends}{%
\subsection{Strong seasonal trends}\label{strong-seasonal-trends}}

NOAA marine recreational fishing catch totals for North Carolina show
strong seasonal trends. Many more fish are caught in the summer, and
much fewer fish are caught in the winter, as demonstrated above (Figure
1). This seasonality is likely influenced by recreational fishing
patterns, where fishers are more likely to fish in warm summer weather
than cool winter weather. Another potential cause for the seasonal
trends is fish abundance and migration patterns, with higher populations
of fish in North Carolina waters during the summer than during the
winter. Total catch trends for all fish and black sea bass showed
unimodal peaks and valleys overall, while bluefish showed bimodal trends
(Figure 1). These bimodal bluefish peaks could be due to their seasonal
migration patterns (\href{http://www.asmfc.org/species/bluefish}{ASMFC
2021}). Another possible explanation for their bimodal trends is that
bluefish in the northern Atlantic Ocean spawn twice annually, once in
the spring and once in the summer (Arthur \& Walford 1979).

\hypertarget{overall-positive-trend}{%
\subsection{Overall positive trend}\label{overall-positive-trend}}

There was an increase in total catch of bluefish, black sea bass, and
all species combined over time. The driver of this increase in
recreational fishery landings is unknown, but it could be attributed to
increased fishing effort, with more fishers participating in
recreational fishing or individual fishers catching more fish.

section -- working on this! - Annie

Although the trend was generally positive for all three time series, it
was not uniform; in other words, the rate of change varied over time,
and there were brief periods where catch plateaued or decreased. This
variation could be caused by changes in recreational fishing regulations
over time, such as the increase or decrease of catch limits and size
limits, or temporary area closures. Furthermore, recreational fishing is
subject to the myriad of factors that can influence human behavior,
including but not limited to climate variation (Dundas \& von Haefen
2020) and events with an environmental impact such as hurricanes (Smee
et al.~2020) or the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill (Alvarez et al.~2014).
In a recent example of how other current events could impact
recreational fishing that is beyond the scope of our analysis extending
only to the end of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic could have either
increased recreational fishing in 2020, when people were spending more
time outside, or decreased recreational fishing, as people were less
able to travel to the coast.

\hypertarget{limitations}{%
\subsection{Limitations}\label{limitations}}

The MRIP system works very well for its intended purposes, but it is
ultimately still a system based on estimation. Through MRIP, NOAA
interviews only some fishers, then uses mathematical modeling to
extrapolate on this collected survey data in order to create statewide
(or area-wide, depending on the dataset) estimates. While MRIP is the
best source of recreational fishing catch data, there is always room for
some error in its estimations.

Within each of our datasets, there were some missing values. These
values were not side by side or frequent, so we chose to linearly
interpolate our data in order to fill them in. This helped our figures
and analyses (e.g.~seasonal Mann-Kendall) to appear and run cleaner, but
interpolating has some drawbacks. While interpolations seemed to follow
the clear seasonal pattern in each dataset, most often the interpolated
data was in wave periods that were minimums in other years of the
datasets, so our interpolated values may have been a bit higher than
actual catch rates during those times. Interpolation is an estimator for
missing data, and it is important to acknowledge that our interpolated
data may not be representative of true values.

Finally, our forecasted data are much cleaner and less noisy than our
existing data. Noise in these datasets comes from external factors like
changes in fish catch limits or weather patterns, which this forecasting
method can neither take into account nor predict. Our forecasting
outputs are therefore limited by the relatively simple methodology we
chose to employ. Holt-Winters remains a popular forecasting method and
is reasonable to use for our purposes here, but the inherent uncertainty
in this predicted data is important to acknowledge.

\hypertarget{future-recommendations}{%
\subsection{Future recommendations}\label{future-recommendations}}

Future research could extend our analysis to include a greater scope
regarding specific species, areas, and timelines. NOAA provides catch
data for an extensive number of fish species, and therefore time-series
and forecasting analysis could also be applied to other species of
interest. Likewise, the widespread area available for NOAA catch data
means that future research could translate our analysis toward catch
numbers from other states. Additionally, the available data goes beyond
the timeline we analyzed, dating back to 1981. Future analysis could
adjust variables of interest accordingly thanks to the vast NOAA data
available for public access.

In addition to adjusting the sample for analysis, future research could
compare changes of catch per unit of effort over time. Analyzing total
catch does not incorporate the number of fishers or success rates.
Incorporating the catch per unit of effort could reveal possible causes
of the increasing catch trends over time (e.g.~more fishers in total or
more efficient fishers).
