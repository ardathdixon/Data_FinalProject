## About the Data  
  
Marine Recreational Information Program (MRIP) data were retrieved from NOAA Recreational Fisheries Statistics Queries “download query” tool (found at https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/data-tools/recreational-fisheries-statistics-queries). 

We completed time series analysis for fishing trends in North Carolina. Specifically, we compared total catch rates between all fish, bluefish, and black sea bass from 1990 to 2019. We performed statistical analysis (Seasonal Mann-Kendall tests) and forecasting predictions to analyze these trends. 

### Inputs for data retrieval from query tool:  
  
**All fish**: FROM 1990 TO 2019, DATA TYPE = "ESTIMATE: CATCH", WAVE OPTIONS = "ALL WAVES", GEOGRAPHICAL AREA STATE/AREA = "NORTH CAROLINA", SPECIES = "ALL SPECIES" (Check box), OUTPUT FORM = "DOWNLOAD CSV AS ZIP FILE".   
  
**Bluefish**: FROM 1990 TO 2019, DATA TYPE = "ESTIMATE: CATCH", WAVE OPTIONS = "ALL WAVES", GEOGRAPHICAL AREA STATE/AREA = "NORTH CAROLINA", SPECIES = "BLUEFISH" (Selection tool), OUTPUT FORM = "DOWNLOAD CSV AS ZIP FILE".  
  
**Black Sea Bass**: FROM 1990 TO 2019, DATA TYPE = "ESTIMATE: CATCH", WAVE OPTIONS = "ALL WAVES", GEOGRAPHICAL AREA STATE/AREA = "NORTH CAROLINA", SPECIES = "BLACK SEA BASS" (Selection tool), OUTPUT FORM = "DOWNLOAD CSV AS ZIP FILE".
